Homelab will be the complete stack I use for cybersecurity research. It will include:
1. Operating System - Qubes OS
2. Text Editor & IDE (Neovim)
3. Version Control System (GitHub, Git, lazygit.lua)
4. Uncensored LLM for Pentesting (Uncensored ollama.lua, plugin for Neovim)
5. Markdown note-taking system (obsidian.lua, plugin for Neovim)
6. System for Publishing Documentation (GitHub Pages, I think this is CLI)

This stack will allow me to have an efficient system for hacking boxes and
documenting my cybersecurity journey all from within my terminal emulator.

Everything I need will be at my fingertips.
